# paypal

This is a basic template for integrating PayPal into a WordPress site using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/conceptacherono/paypal.git


2. Open the cloned directory:

    cd paypal

3. Replace the dummy PayPal credentials with your own in `script.js`. You can create a [sandbox PayPal account](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/create) for testing purposes.

4. Customize the HTML and CSS files to match your website's design and structure.

5. Test the integration:

    - Open `index.html` in a web browser.
    - Click on the PayPal button (you can customize this button as per PayPal's guidelines).
    - Follow the PayPal checkout process in the provided modal or redirect.

6. Remember to follow security best practices when handling real payments. For production, consider server-side integration to keep sensitive data secure.
